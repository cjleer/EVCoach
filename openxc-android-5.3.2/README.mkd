OpenXC Android Library
=========================

This library is a part of the [OpenXC][] project.

This Android library contains the tools required to read vehicle data from the
vehicle's CAN bus through the OpenXC vehicle interface in any Android
application.

Visit the [OpenXC][] project page for
[installation
instructions](http://openxcplatform.com/getting-started/library-installation.html),
[usage details](http://openxcplatform.com/android/api-guide.html) and the
[source code documentation](http://android.openxcplatform.com).

## Building from Eclipse

After cloning the `openxc-android` repository to your local disk, open Eclipse
and go to `File -> New -> Other -> Android -> Android Project from Existing
Source`. Browse to the `openxc-android` folder and it should detect the 4
Android projects within the repository. At the minimum, add the `openxc` project
(the Android library itself) and `OpenXcEnablerActivity` (the Enabler app,
required to run OpenXC applications).

## Building from Command Line

The build requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
v3.0.3+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

    export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/tools/android-sdk

You also need the Android support library, but unfortunately Google doesn't
deploy the latest versions of this to the the Central Maven repository. Instead,
you must open the Android SDK manager and install the "Android Support
Repository" package (under "Extras"). Next, open a terminal and navigate to your
SDK's top-level directory (e.g. `/home/user/android-sdk`.

You must manually copy the Maven artifacts from this folder to your local
repository:

    $ cp -R $ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/m2repository/com ~/.m2/repository

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

To compile the OpenXC library as an APKLIB and install it to your local
Maven repository:

    $ mvn install -pl openxc -am

To compile and build and APK for the Enabler app (that uses the OpenXC
library):

    $ mvn package -pl enabler

Finally, to deploy the packaged APK to an attached Android device and run it:

    $ mvn android:deploy android:run -pl enabler

* Run `mvn clean install -pl openxc,openxc-it -am` from the root directory to build and run
  the library and test suite. This requires that an Android device is attached or an
  emulator is running.

If you want the tests to wait for a debugger to attach, change the `testDebug`
setting in `openxc-android/pom.xml` to `true`.
